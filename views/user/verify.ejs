                            <h3>Statutory Guarantees and Warranties to Consumers </h3>
                            18.  Schedule 2 of the  Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (“C&C Act”) defines a 
                            consumer. Under the C&C Act we are a supplier of either goods or services or both to 
                            you, and as a consumer the C&C Act gives you statutory guarantees. Attached to the 
                            Standard Terms and Conditions are:
                            a.  Schedule 2 of the C&C Act; and
                            b.  those statutory guarantees, all of which are given by us to you if you are a 
                            consumer.
                            19.  If you are a consumer within the meaning of Schedule 2 of the  C&C Act of our goods 
                            or services then we give you a warranty that at the time of supply of those goods or 
                            services to you, if they are defective then:
                            a.  We will repair or replace the goods or any part of them that is defective; or
                            b.  Provide again or rectify any services or part of them that are defective; or
                            c.  Wholly or partly recompense you if they are defective.
                            20.  As a consumer under the C&C Act you may be entitled to receive from us notices under 
                            Schedule 2 section 103 of the C&C Act. In that regard:
                            a.  If you are a consumer within the meaning of Schedule 2 of the C&C Act and 
                            the goods or services  we are providing relate to the repair of consumer goods 
                            then we will give you any notice which we are obliged to give you under 
                            Schedule 2 section 103 of the C&C Act.
                            b.  If we are a repairer of goods capable of retaining user-generated data then we 
                            hereby  give you notice that the repair of those goods may result in the loss of 
                            the data. 
                            c.  If we are a repairer and our practice is to supply refurbished goods as an 
                            alternative to repairing your defective goods or to use refurbished parts in the 
                            repair, then we give you notice that the goods presented by you to us for repair 
                            may be replaced by refurbished goods of the same type rather than being 
                            repaired. We also give you notice that we may use in the repair of your goods, 
                            refurbished parts.
                            <h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>
                            21.  If you are not a consumer within the meaning of Schedule 2 of the C&C Act then this 
                            clause applies to you. If you are a consumer within the meaning of the C&C Act then 
                            this clause has no effect whatsoever to in any way limit our liability or your rights. If 
                            you are not a consumer: 
                            a.  To the full extent permitted by law, our liability for breach of an implied 
                            warranty or condition is limited to the supply of the services again or payment 
                            of the costs of having those services supplied again. 
                            b.  We accept no liability for any loss whatsoever including consequential loss 
                            suffered by you arising from services we have supplied. 
                            c.  We do not accept liability for anything contained in the post of a user or in any 
                            form of communication which originates with a user and not with Us.
                            d.  We do not participate in any way in the transactions between our users.

                            22.  By accessing our website, you agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from all claims, 
                            actions, damages, costs and expenses including legal fees arising from or in connection 
                            with your use of our website. 
                            <h3>Jurisdiction</h3>
                            23.  These terms and conditions are to be governed by and construed in accordance with the 
                            laws of Victoria and any claim made by either party against the other which in any way 
                            arises  out of  these terms and conditions  will be heard in  Victoria  and  you agree to
                            submit to the jurisdiction of those Courts.
                            24.  If any provision  in  these terms and conditions  is invalid under any law the provision 
                            will be limited, narrowed, construed or altered as necessary to render it valid but only to 
                            the extent necessary to achieve such validity. If necessary the invalid provision will be 
                            deleted from these terms and conditions  and the remaining provisions will remain in 
                            full force and effect.
